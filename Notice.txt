Explication :


You just have the cscfeature.xml and the cscfeature_network.xml of a single csc to decode or encode:


1. Put your file(s) in the _In folder.

2. In OMC_Decoder_Encoder choose 1 to decode or 2 to encode and validate.

3. If there were no problems, your file (s) will be found in the _Out folder.

4. Move your file(s) before to continue.

5. It's finish.


You have several OMC to decode or encode:


1. Put the XXX folders XXX (where XXX is the OMC name like XEF, BTU, ITV ...) in the _InOMC folder.

Warning: It can have OMC in the single folder, thinks to put them in the _InOMC folder.

2. In OMC_Decoder_Encoder choose 3 to decode multiple OMC or 4 to encode multiple OMC and validate.

3. Wait during the work. The duration is variable depending on the number of OMC and the working power of your computer.

4. Once finished, you will find your files in the _OutOMC folder.

I advise you to move the entire _OutOMC folder in the _InOMC, then move the entire _InOMC folder where you want it.
In this way your OMC folders will be complete.

7. It's finish.

Enjoy
