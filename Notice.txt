OMC Decoder-Encoder

This program is a batch script witch can code and decode
OMC files as CSCFeature and CSCFeature_network from recent devices

This program is developed by Yoanf26@PhonAndroid
Omc-decoder.jar credits goes to ispar fei-ke@XDA

Thanks to him.

Usage :

1. Extract file OMC_Decoder-Encoder_By_Yoanf26.zip where you want.
2. Launch OMC_Decoder_Encoder.exe so that he prepares his workspace and asks you for the language you want.
3. Enter the number and confirm with the Enter key

You just have the cscfeature.xml and the cscfeature_network.xml of a single csc to decode or encode:

1. Put your file(s) in the _In folder.
2. In OMC_Decoder_Encoder choose 1 to decode or 2 to encode and validate.
3. If there were no problems, your file (s) will be found in the _Out folder.
4. Move your file(s) before to continue.
5. It's finish.

You have several OMC to decode or encode:

1. Put the XXX folders XXX (where XXX is the OMC name like XEF, BTU, ITV ...) in the _InOMC folder.
Warning: It can have OMC in the single folder, thinks to put them in the _InOMC folder.
2. Please check that other folders than XXX are not present as this may cause errors.
3. In OMC_Decoder_Encoder choose 3 to decode multiple OMC or 4 to encode multiple OMC and validate.
4. Wait during the work. The duration is variable depending on the number of OMC and the working power of your computer.
5. Once finished, you will find your files in the _OutOMC folder.
6. Move your file(s) before to continue.
Warning: The Folders are incomplete.
I advise you to move the entire _OutOMC folder in the _InOMC, then move the entire _InOMC folder where you want it.
In this way your OMC folders will be complete.
7. It's finish.
Enjoy
